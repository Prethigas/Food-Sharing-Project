* Notify nearby volunteers for **timely food collection**
* Maintain **records** of donors and volunteers for tracking and coordination

This system facilitates efficient food redistribution while ensuring **data management** and **secure communication**. By leveraging this platform, individuals can help reduce food waste and combat hunger in their communities.
